# Communities Custom Navigation Menu

Navigation menus are great for declaratively managing a set of a list of navigation menu items that you can access programmatically within a custom component. A very common use case for a custom navigation component is the display of social links on a community. It is a design pattern seen throughout the web and a great way for a company to promote their social presence. There are quite a few ways that we could achieve this with code, but using a navigation menu will give an admin the ability to manage the menu items using a familiar tool.
